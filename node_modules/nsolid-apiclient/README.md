nsolid-apiclient
---

A very simple client for the REST-like N|Solid Storage API.

```js
var Client = require("nsolid-apiclient")
var client = Client("https://localhost:4000")

var contentStream = client.read('metrics', {start: '-5m', end: '-1m'})
```

API
---

All `endpoint` parameters should be an https URL to an N|Solid Storage server.

Creating a client
===

    var Client = require("nsolid-apiclient")
    var client = Client(endpoint)

Create a new client with the specified `endpoint` pre-configured.

Client methods
===

read
---

    var responseStream = client.read(command[, options])

Send the command with optional `options` object. The `options` object will be converted to query parameters. These commands will read cached or stored data in the N|Solid Storage system versus fetching data from the N|Solid processes.

exec
---

    var responseStream = client.exec(command[, options])

Instruct the proxy to execute the command on each N|Solid Agent (with optional filters specified in `options`)
